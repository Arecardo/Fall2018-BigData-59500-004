        Below are the three functions which I defined in this program
'''
from copy import deepcopy
#For using the deepcopy() function, I have to import the copy library
#I searched on the Internet to find the function to copy a dictionary
#finally I found it, below is the Website
#https://www.cnblogs.com/mokero/p/6662202.html

def DisplayTheGrades(newGrades):
    #This function is to display the grades in different subjects for each student.
    #input: newGrades(dict)
    #output: information(string)
    print("student" + "  ECE595" + "  ECE547" + "  ECE354\n")

        print(str(foo).ljust(7) + str(newGrades[foo][0]).rjust(5) + str(newGrades[foo][1]).rjust(8) + str(newGrades[foo][2]).rjust(9))
    #print newGrades.
    #ljust() and rjust() are used to adjust the position of outputs, 
    #which makes it easier to read
    #this is the website which these functions come from
    #http://www.runoob.com/python/att-string-rjust.html


def DisplayTheHighest(Grades):
    #This function is to display the highest score and scorer in each subject.
    #input: Grades(dict)
    #output: information(string,highest score and its scorer)
    print("Please select a course:")
    choice = int(input("1.ECE595 2.ECE547 3.ECE354\n"))
    choice -= 1
    #user chooses the course he want
    temp1 = 0

def DisplayTheGPA(Grades, newGrades):
    #This function is to display the GPA of each student.
    #The credit hours for each course is 3 
    #and points for A, B, C, D, and F are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively.

The functions which I build in this program are still can be improved.
The difficulties of this task mainly concentrate on how to find
a proper and handy structure to store and handle the data
There must be better solutions on the Internet.
Peace :)
